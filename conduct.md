## Deadlines

To determine appropriate deadlines conduct policies it is first important to
break up deadlines into the different types of possible deadlines for the
course. The deadlines categories that are possible are those when working
directly with group members to finish work necessary to move onto other parts
of the lab, along with completing your assigned portion of the work by the due
date of the lab.

* **Acceptable Behavior (C)**

* Talk with team members and discuss work needed to be done.

* Set up a reasonable time frame for when the work should be completed
  leaving time for the rest of the lab.

* Take into consideration other people's schedules and activities as it may
  not align with yours.

* If you can not come up with an agreed upon time frame, have a vote
  between teammates that are present to determine the time frame.

* If problems still arise then seek out other team members.

* Grade yourself based on the grading scale given to determine how well you
  followed the deadlines section. Grading scale is as follows,

* All software project assignments completed have a specified due date, whereas
  the electronic copy must be uploaded to GitHub through the designated repository
  before the assigned deadline.

* Software projects will be completed according to the deadline set by
  the students, and within the one week period before the next laboratory session
  begins.

* **Unacceptable Behavior (U)**

* Not discussing things with team members on due dates.

* Not completing work on time.

* Not participating in votes on material.

* Not communicating reasons for work being late and not on time.

* If work is submitted after the specified deadline, the assignment will not be
  accepted and no credit will be given (unless specified otherwise). All submitted
  software project assignments must contain high-quality, well documented code.

## Communication

*Team members shall communicate fully, openly, and promptly regarding individual
comfort level and progress with an assigned task.*

* **Slack shall be the primary method of communication**

* **Acceptable Communication (C):**

* *Members shall*
  * Communicate to others when they will be unable to attend any meeting
  * Communicate about work in progress and personal time constraints.
  * Share any encountered problem immediately so the team can work toward a solution.
  * Critique the idea pitched, not the person pitching it.

* *Team Leads Shall*

  * Abuse leadership role to make members complete work unrelated to the class work
  * Abuse leadership role to berate or act negatively towards team members.

## Participation

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work.
Participation gives room for exchange of ideas that people can work on and
implement as a group. In order to achieve the goals for the group, it is the
sole responsibility of every team member to be involved in the work going on.
The more we put into our efforts, the better will be the outcome. This can be
an amazing opportunity to bond well with the team members and bring positivity
that will bring long-term benefits for the team.

* **Acceptable Participation (C):**
  * Participating in Slack discussions
  * Being open to meeting outside of class time
  * Asking questions
  * Sharing one's views without triggering someone else's
  * Enabling discussions in a polite and pleasant form
  * Disagreeing in a polite manner if required

* **Unacceptable Participation (U):**
  * Not participating in Slack Polls
  * Missing lab sections without consent of the course instructor
  * Not asking questions or participating in discussions
  * Not doing your share of the labs
  * Interrupting a team member with criticism without offering him/her the
    opportunity to share their views
  * Passing offensive comments during discussions
  * Trying to dominate a discussion
  * Talking about topics entirely irrelevant to the discussions

## Decision

Decisions should be made in the environment that every team member's opinion
is considered important. They should be made collectively as a team or at
least 80% of the majority's consensus. All information needed to make a
decision will be clearly stated to every team member and all concerns should
be clearly expressed. We will use data, rational knowledge and specific
experience to make decisions instead of popular opinion. Team members need to
objectively analyzed the options for the best of the team. Trust and respect
the decision made in order to move on the project.

* **Unacceptable (U):**
  * Making decisions without notifying team members.
  * Question the decision after it is made.
  * Making a decision based on only popular opinion.

## Infractions

An ***infraction*** shall hereby be defined as a penalty given as a result of a
violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide by any individual who has agreed
to adhere to the Conduct Guide via digital signature below. The infractions for
any individual shall be recorded and managed by the instructor.

A *violation* of the Conduct Guide is defined as any behavior that results in receiving
a "U" (Unacceptable) for any of the above outlined (sub)sections.

Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:

* **Level I**: A ***Level I infraction*** is defined as a formally documented
 violation of the above outlined Conduct Guide. A Level I infraction may be
 suggested to the instructor by a team or project leader for any given project.
 All Level I infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level II**: A ***Level II infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated three Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level II infraction,
 the individual will no longer be eligible to receive a check for the week. All
 Level II infractions will be reset weekly.
* **Level III**: A ***Level III infraction*** will be given to an individual who
 has accumulated five Level I infractions. Upon obtaining a Level III infraction,
 the individual will be docked 10% of their grade for the current project. All
 Level III infractions will be reset after the completion of the current project.

If an individual commits multiple violations of the Conduct Guide, a team or
project leader may suggest a proportional amount of Level I infractions for the
violations to the instructor, provided there is proper citation to the Conduct
Guide for the violations. While a team or project leader may suggest any number
of infractions, an individual *should* not incur more than **three** infractions
for a single instance of violations. The number of Level I infractions imposed
upon the individual shall ultimately be determined by the instructor.

An individual who has received any number of infractions may appeal said
infraction(s) directly to the instructor of the course. Any decision received
from the instructor for being given the infraction(s) will be final.
